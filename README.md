a [tosu](https://github.com/kotrikd/tosu/) overlay that displays hit count for each judgement and a chart to represent it all!   
developed for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) mania, but using it in another gamemode with display missing judgements that dont exist for the mode or a mismatching names for judgements like geki and katu in standard, although chart will be mostly accurate
